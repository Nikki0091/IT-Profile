As a Senior Developer at Lumary you will be enhancing the Lumary products using clean, functional and tested code. You will work as part of an Agile team, adopting the best practices and implementing them in everyday tasks.

Our roles are defined to an extent so we (and our peers) understand our key domain/s as detailed above and below in ‘a day in the life’. However, we don't restrict people by title or function -  the team members do whatever they can, using whatever skills they have to achieve the goals. Everyone is supported and encouraged to sense the environment around them, identify and solve problems, contribute insights, and add value wherever they can across Lumary.

Lumary's culture encourages problem-solving, innovation and outside the box thinking and celebrates creativity.

Working with your team, you will feel empowered to decide how you are going to shape the Lumary products to provide quality outcomes for our customers.  With insights from our customer success, product teams, and user groups, take ownership and be proactive, innovate and continue to evolve our product suite so that we can improve the quality of life for our customers' participants
